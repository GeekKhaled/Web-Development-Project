# WDProject

This is my project that me and my 3 colleagues did as a project in Web Development Course.
Basically it is a site that provides books that is related to Computer Science From security all the way to Programming

The idea is we compare the prices from websites and link it to you in the comfort of one website, so we do not have inventory it is all online 

We did SQL Database linked to our website too.
